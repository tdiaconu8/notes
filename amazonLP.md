# Leadership principles

## Customer obsession
* Always work to keep customer trust. Be obsess with the customers, it is the main key of a project.
* In my current experience, customer is the key point. It is very important to respond to a customer. I am currently working on the internal payroll software. I always interact with the customers, i.e. the Human Ressources and Payroll departments. I organized a lot of **test sessions** with customers, in order to have feedbacks and correct bugs. Customer feedbacks are very important for the success of a project.
## Personal investment
## Invent and simplify
## To be right
## Learn and be curious
* Learn something new everyday is very important, especially in computer science. Always be ope, to new tools and possibilities. 
* For example, when I started as a freelance software engineer in parallel with my studies, I taught myself Angular framework to develop web applications. I developed about 3 web applications during the first experience. Then I was involved in a major application and now I am the front-end lead developer on Angular stack technology.
## Hire and develop the best
## To be challenging
## Think big
## Action
* Important to take reversible actions fast. No need to deeply study them.
* **Sopra Banking - ML Project.** My project was to identify if a person will or not buy an EV, according to psychographic data that can ben found in a bank. The drawback was that I had no available data or dataset. Thus I decided to explore online datasets and surveys, to cross them and use to build a model for a PoC.
## Accomplish more with less
## Earn Trust
* Earning the trust of my teammates or customers is always very important. When I started y experience, I was designed as the front-end lead developer. I always tried to have interest to what are currently doing the other front-end developers by asking questions, making code reviews, and so on. 
* The team manager designed me as the main lead developer of the application. I always try to have interest to other's tasks. However, I always try to have a critical position: to me it's important to analyze the limits of something done. Criticizing is not negative. For example, when I started the project, I remarked that the front-end uses a lot of built Angular libraries. I was not convinced by this approach, so I decided to change the concerned code by using classical HTML/CSS.
## Deep analysis
## Disagree and commit --> have backbane
* When I am convinced about something, I always keep this position, even if it is against my manager. I will discuss with him and try to demonstrate that my point of view is correct.
* **CI/CD.** I was convinced that CI/CD is really important for a project, especially when production approaches. My manager told me that CI is sufficient, and that making PR with manually deployment is a kind of CI/CD. I disagreed, and made presentations in order to implement CI/CD properly: Azure Devops tickets, code reviews & CD on GitLab.
